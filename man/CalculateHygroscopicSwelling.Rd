\usage{
CalculateHygroscopicSwelling(
  DryParticleDiameter_m,
  AerosolType,
  RelHum_percent
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DryParticleDiameter_m}{The diameter of the particles before application
of hygroscopic swelling (dry) in m.}

\item{AerosolType}{Hygroscopic swelling differs depending on aerosol type.
Implemented types are (1) "Dry" for no swelling, (2) "SeaSalt", (3)  "Urban",
(4) "Rural" and (5) "AmmoniumSulfate".}

\item{RelHum_percent}{Relative humidity in percent.}
}
\value{
A vector of particle diameters after accounting for hygroscopic
swelling in m.
}
\description{
Calculates increase in particle diameter due to water update
according to Zhang et al. (2001) eq. 10. All parameters must be vectors of
same lengths. Note that a correction has been applied to Zhang et al.
(2001) eq. 10: The whole equation is raised to the power of 1/3, following
the original publication provided by Zhang et al. (2001) as reference
(Gerber 1985). Without this correction, the wet diameter is often smaller
compared to the dry diameter.
